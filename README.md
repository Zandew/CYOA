The proposal will include an overall description of the game your team would like to create.

Each person is responsible for writing a section on their own level. This section should include detailed descriptions of the rules of the game, actions the player can take, etc. It should also include screen sketches and a flowchart to show the general flow of the level.

There should also be a schedule with a list of goals and the dates that they should be completed by.

Our game is a choose your own adventure story where you start off with a pokemon partner. You have to try and beat the final boss by going through rooms and battling wild pokemon and guards. You can get extra moves by completing sidequests and exploring areas. 

Each pokemon has health and attack stats. Your pokemon goes first, and you attack your pokemon based on your attack stat. Each attack does between 0.7 and 1 times the max attack. If your health goes to 0 before the opponents' does, you lose.

You take sidequests from an NPC.
